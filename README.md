# sunglasses-face-filter-project

First steps on Computer Vision. I leveraged open cv library in python to develop a intagram stories face filter of sunglasses just like instagram and snapchat.

Still a Proof of Concept, but introduced me to some concepts while studying on how to do it such as Haars Cascade Classifiers.

Just awsome how mmuch you can do by only leveraging open source libraries and pre-trained models.

Next steps:

1. Train my own CNN ot understand how it works
2. Explore R-CNNs and Yolo algorithms
3. Develop an end-to-end application/game that trains an AI model
	- Prompts user an image and objects classes to be identifyied
	- Asks user to draw the bounding contours (rectangle) to identify each object in the image
	- Then it stores the class labels for each image and its contours coordinates as metadata
	- Train ML model based on user inputs (or simulated user inputs)
